        <h2>GraphQL</h2>
        
        <p>Unlike REST, GraphQL is actually a query language allowing clients to request the exact data they need in the format they need it.</p>
        
        <p>In the case of precision, it has a big advantage over REST APIs which often return more data than you need (we all know that one person that overshares) or require you to make multiple requests to get the data you want.</p>
        
        <p>It is also strongly typed and that means you can validate your queries before executing them, which helps prevent errors, ensuring you get the data you expect.</p>
        
        <p>What can be difficult, because GraphQL is relatively new compared to REST, it has a smaller community (that is growing rapidly), fewer tools and libraries available and it can be more complex to design and implement.</p>

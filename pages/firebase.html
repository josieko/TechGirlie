    <h1>Firebase</h1>
    <br><br>

    <p><b>And here we have another Google girlie, Firebase.</b></p>

    <p>It is a mobile and web application development platform offering a suite of tools and services to help developers build, grow, and maintain their apps.</p>

    <p>It provides a number of pre-built services that you can use to add common features to your apps like user authentication, data storage, and push notifications. Firebase also provides a variety of tools to help monitor and improve your apps, such as analytics and crash reporting.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of using Firebase</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>It is easy to use even for beginners since it has many tutorials and documentation to help you get started.</li>
        <li>It is scalable and can support apps of any size. That’s why it’s a good tool to use regardless of being in a small company or a massive one.</li>
        <li>It is reliable, backed by Google and built on top of its infrastructure known for security.</li>
        <li>It is affordable because it offers plans depending on the size of your project and budget. You can start with the free plan and if your app outgrows the free plan, you can pay as you go.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to set up</h2>

    <p>Just like setting up Flutter, if you decide to go for the official tutorial, it is good to have your Mac prepared.</p>

    <p>We are using a Mac setup, but you can <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install" class="link">visit here if you use a different OS.</a></p>

    <p>To set up for Firebase, all you need to have installed before cracking on with it is Xcode (you can skip this step if you already followed Flutter setup).</p>

    <p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12" class="link">Download Xcode</a></p>

    <p>If you installed Xcode, you are ready to <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/_/overview?purchaseBillingPlan=no-cost&_gl=1*yzjuor*_ga*MzM0NTYwOTU5LjE2OTY5NDU5MDA.*_ga_CW55HF8NVT*MTY5Njk0NTg5OS4xLjEuMTY5Njk0NjQyMC4yOS4wLjA.">create your first Firebase project</a></p>

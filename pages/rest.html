        <p>Don’t let the name fool you because this girl puts in the work!</p>
        
        <p>Short for “Representational State Transfer”, a REST API is an architectural style defining a set of constraints to be used for creating web services. It is a way of accessing web services in a simple and flexible way without having any processing.</p>
        
        <p>If you ever thought of making an app that relies on data from a 3rd party online service, you will definitely come across REST since that is the most common way of implementing APIs on the web.</p>
        
        <p>REST APIs mostly communicate with JSON data even though no specification requires request or response data to be in JSON, it became a convention because it is easy to resolve in almost any language.</p>
        
        <p>It is good to know that REST APIs are typically stateless, meaning that each request contains all the information that the server needs to process it. That’s also what makes it easy to scale.</p>
        
        <p>It is also simple to implement and can be used to expose a wide variety of data and resources, also having a massive, well-established community of developers and tools.</p>

        <h3>What it is</h3>
        <p>So letâ€™s start with APIs first. What are they?</p>
        
        <p>API, which stands for "Application Programming Interface", is a term you'll frequently encounter in the tech world. Think of an API as a magic gateway that enables different software applications to communicate and share information with each other. Just like in your everyday life, where you connect with friends through conversations, APIs allow software programs to connect and exchange data seamlessly.</p>
        
        <p>Imagine you're using a weather app on your smartphone. The app fetches up-to-the-minute weather data from a weather service, like magic! Well, that magic is made possible by an API. The weather service provides an API that allows the weather app to request data like temperature, humidity, and forecasts.</p>
        
        <p>If you watched Sex and the City, you know very well who Samantha Jones is. <b>(we love her)</b></p>
        <br>

        <br>
        <p>Imagine you're an aspiring writer, but don't have direct contacts with publishers and not sure where to start. That's where Samantha, our trusty PR girl, comes into play. Samantha is well-connected and has a knack for networking, just like an API connects and communicates with different software systems.</p>
        
        <p>In this scenario, Samantha serves as your API. You (API user) reach out to Samantha with your manuscript (API request). She takes your book and talks to various publishers on your behalf to find a match for your manuscript.</p>
        
        <p>Once Samantha has spoken with publishers (API provider), she comes back to you with the information on publishers that are interested in your book (API response). Samantha acts as the intermediary, simplifying the complex process of getting your book published.</p>
        
        <p>Just like an API makes it possible for different software systems to exchange information seamlessly, Samantha connects you, the writer, with the publishers, making your publishing journey smoother and more efficient.</p>
        
        <p>How the API works in this story:</p>
        
        <ul class="graph">
           <b style="font-size: 22px;">Writer (API user) -> Samantha (API) -> Publishers (API provider)</b> 
        </ul>
        
        <h3>What can it be used for</h3>
        <p>Now that you understand better what it is, let's see how can we use APIs. Because they are versatile, just like you, they can be used for many things like:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Fetching data from a server such as the weather forecast or latest news and store products</li>
            <li>Sending data to a server like when you upload a photo to social media or submit a form on a website</li>
            <li>Performing actions on a server like when you send an email or create a new user account</li>
            <li>Building new applications and services like a weather app that uses an API to get the weather forecast info to display it in the app</li>
        </ul>

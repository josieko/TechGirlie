        <h2 style="color: #f64995;">Coming back to Samantha - <b>Let's compare</b></h2>
        
        <p><b>This time it’s Samantha REST (Samantha R) vs Samantha GraphQL (Samantha G).</b></p>
        
        <p>You would ask each of them in a different way to get you a publisher.</p>
        
        <p>Samantha R might have different endpoints for getting you a list of all the publishers she knows, another endpoint for a specific publisher and an endpoint for actually submitting a manuscript to a publisher.</p>
        
        <p>For example, if you want to take your chance and get a list of all the publishers she knows, you would place your request to the “all publishers” endpoint.</p>
        
        <p>Samantha would then process your request and return a response in JSON format containing the list of publishers, or the information about the specific publisher you requested, or the status of your manuscript submission.</p>
        
        <p>With Samantha G, things are a bit different. This Samantha has a single endpoint that you can use to ask her for publishers, and to find a publisher for your manuscript, you would send a GraphQL query to the endpoint, specifying the data you need.</p>
        
        <p>For example, you might send a query that asks for the names and contact information of all publishers who are interested in publishing mystery novels (genre of your book).</p>
        
        <p>Samantha would then parse and validate your query/request, and then fetch the requested data from her database. She would then return a response in JSON format, containing the information you requested (names and contact information) about all the publishers doing mystery novels.</p>

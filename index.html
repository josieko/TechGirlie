<h1>Nail The Tech Jargon: Understanding APIs, GraphQL, and REST</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p>Hey girl, heey!</p>

<p>Welcome to the world of tech, where the possibilities, innovation and creativity are endless! As women getting into tech, it can be scary since we’re still under represented (making up 26% of the tech industry 👁️👄👁️) and this is the perfect moment for us to start making those big moves!</p>

<p>We are here to diversify the industry, making tech a better place.</p>

<p>It all pretty much started from women too. You probably heard of Ada Lovelace, the absolute queen-mother of tech who wrote the first computer programme in the world.</p>

<p>Just like her, you are making big steps by reading this post, challenging yourself and we’re sure you are going to become a heck of a programmer and the “tech it girl” 👩🏼‍💻</p>

<p>This exciting journey may initially seem hard, especially when faced with technical jargon like "APIs," "GraphQL," and "REST". But we got you girl because we're going to demystify these terms and provide you with a clear understanding of what they are and how you can use them.</p>

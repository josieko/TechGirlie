<h1>Nail The Tech Jargon: Understanding APIs, GraphQL, and REST</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p>Hey girl, heey!</p>

<p>Welcome to the world of tech, where the possibilities, innovation and creativity are endless! As women getting into tech, it can be scary since we’re still under represented (making up 26% of the tech industry 👁️👄👁️) and this is the perfect moment for us to start making those big moves!</p>

<p>We are here to diversify the industry, making tech a better place.</p>

<p>It all pretty much started from women too. You probably heard of Ada Lovelace, the absolute queen-mother of tech who wrote the first computer programme in the world.</p>

<p>Just like her, you are making big steps by reading this post, challenging yourself and we’re sure you are going to become a heck of a programmer and the “tech it girl” 👩🏼‍💻</p>

<p>This exciting journey may initially seem hard, especially when faced with technical jargon like "APIs," "GraphQL," and "REST". But we got you girl because we're going to demystify these terms and provide you with a clear understanding of what they are and how you can use them.</p>
    </div>

<div class="api">
<h2>APIs</h2>

<h3>What it is</h3>
<p>So let’s start with APIs first. What are they?</p>

<p>API, which stands for "Application Programming Interface", is a term you'll frequently encounter in the tech world. Think of an API as a magic gateway that enables different software applications to communicate and share information with each other. Just like in your everyday life, where you connect with friends through conversations, APIs allow software programs to connect and exchange data seamlessly.</p>

<p>Imagine you're using a weather app on your smartphone. The app fetches up-to-the-minute weather data from a weather service, like magic! Well, that magic is made possible by an API. The weather service provides an API that allows the weather app to request data like temperature, humidity, and forecasts.</p>

<p>If you watched Sex and the City, you know very well who Samantha Jones is. <b>(we love her)</b></p>

<p>Imagine you're an aspiring writer, but don't have direct contacts with publishers and not sure where to start. That's where Samantha, our trusty PR girl, comes into play. Samantha is well-connected and has a knack for networking, just like an API connects and communicates with different software systems.</p>

<p>In this scenario, Samantha serves as your API. You (API user) reach out to Samantha with your manuscript (API request). She takes your book and talks to various publishers on your behalf to find a match for your manuscript.</p>

<p>Once Samantha has spoken with publishers (API provider), she comes back to you with the information on publishers that are interested in your book (API response). Samantha acts as the intermediary, simplifying the complex process of getting your book published.</p>

<p>Just like an API makes it possible for different software systems to exchange information seamlessly, Samantha connects you, the writer, with the publishers, making your publishing journey smoother and more efficient.</p>

<p>How the API works in this story:</p>

</ul>

<h3>What can it be used for</h3>
<p>Now that you understand better what it is, let's see how can we use APIs. Because they are versatile, just like you, they can be used for many things like:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Fetching data from a server such as the weather forecast or latest news and store products</li>
    <li>Sending data to a server like when you upload a photo to social media or submit a form on a website</li>
    <li>Performing actions on a server like when you send an email or create a new user account</li>
    <li>Building new applications and services like a weather app that uses an API to get the weather forecast info to display it in the app</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="rest">
<h2>REST</h2>

<p>Don’t let the name fool you because this girl puts in the work!</p>

<p>Short for “Representational State Transfer”, a REST API is an architectural style defining a set of constraints to be used for creating web services. It is a way of accessing web services in a simple and flexible way without having any processing.</p>

<p>If you ever thought of making an app that relies on data from a 3rd party online service, you will definitely come across REST since that is the most common way of implementing APIs on the web.</p>

<p>REST APIs mostly communicate with JSON data even though no specification requires request or response data to be in JSON, it became a convention because it is easy to resolve in almost any language.</p>

<p>It is good to know that REST APIs are typically stateless, meaning that each request contains all the information that the server needs to process it. That’s also what makes it easy to scale.</p>

<p>It is also simple to implement and can be used to expose a wide variety of data and resources, also having a massive, well-established community of developers and tools.</p>

<div class="graphql">
<h2>GraphQL</h2>

<p>Unlike REST, GraphQL is actually a query language allowing clients to request the exact data they need in the format they need it.</p>

<p>In the case of precision, it has a big advantage over REST APIs which often return more data than you need (we all know that one person that overshares) or require you to make multiple requests to get the data you want.</p>

<p>It is also strongly typed and that means you can validate your queries before executing them, which helps prevent errors, ensuring you get the data you expect.</p>

<p>What can be difficult, because GraphQL is relatively new compared to REST, it has a smaller community (that is growing rapidly), fewer tools and libraries available and it can be more complex to design and implement.</p>

<div class="compare">
<h2 style="color: #f64995;">Coming back to Samantha - <b>Let's compare</b></h2>

<p><b>This time it’s Samantha REST (Samantha R) vs Samantha GraphQL (Samantha G).</b></p>

<p>You would ask each of them in a different way to get you a publisher.</p>

<p>Samantha R might have different endpoints for getting you a list of all the publishers she knows, another endpoint for a specific publisher and an endpoint for actually submitting a manuscript to a publisher.</p>

<p>For example, if you want to take your chance and get a list of all the publishers she knows, you would place your request to the “all publishers” endpoint.</p>

<p>Samantha would then process your request and return a response in JSON format containing the list of publishers, or the information about the specific publisher you requested, or the status of your manuscript submission.</p>

<p>With Samantha G, things are a bit different. This Samantha has a single endpoint that you can use to ask her for publishers, and to find a publisher for your manuscript, you would send a GraphQL query to the endpoint, specifying the data you need.</p>

<p>For example, you might send a query that asks for the names and contact information of all publishers who are interested in publishing mystery novels (genre of your book).</p>

<p>Samantha would then parse and validate your query/request, and then fetch the requested data from her database. She would then return a response in JSON format, containing the information you requested (names and contact information) about all the publishers doing mystery novels.</p>

<div class="conclusion">

    <p><b style="font-size: 42px;">You nailed it!</b></p>
    <p style="font-size: 4em;">💅🏻💅🏽💅🏿</p>
<p>Now that you learned about these key tools, we would encourage you to try using one of them. There’s no better way to learn but to try and use these things.</p>

<p>You should be proud of yourself for taking a step forward in learning, we definitely are! Cheers to your tech journey 🍸</p>
